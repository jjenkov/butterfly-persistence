     * As you may have noticed the connection that is scoped
     * is not passed to the IScopeAction in this method.
     * Your implementation of the IScopeAction interface
     * must have a reference to the ScopingDataSource, from
     * which it obtains it's connections. The ScopingDataSource
     * can be obtained from the IScopeFactory you are using,
     * or you can instantiate one yourself. Just remember that
     * the ScopingDataSource referenced by your IScopeAction
     * implementation has to be the same instance as referenced
     * by the IScopeBoundary instance, calling the inScope() method
     * of your IScopeAction implementation.
     *
     * @return An object if your IScopeAction chooses to.
     * @throws Throwable If something goes wrong inside the IScopeAction.
     *                   The surrounding IScopeBoundary object will take
     *                   the correct measures to close the connection and
     *                   rollback any ongoing transaction.
